# MBG

Full-stack application project consisting of a Golang backend (MVC, Clean Code, SOLID, Swagger), a Python AI service (FastAPI + YOLOv8), a React frontend (Vite, Tailwind CSS v4), and an Expo mobile app.

## Project Structure

- **[backend/](backend)**: Golang REST API server built with MVC architecture, Clean Code & SOLID principles, documented with Swagger UI.
- **[backend/ai_service/](backend/ai_service)**: FastAPI AI service that runs the meal classifier and cooked-food freshness classifier on each scan.
- **[backend/data/](backend/data)**: Dataset files (CSV/JSON/XLSX) downloaded from Google Drive.
- **[frontend/](frontend)**: React + Vite web client styled with Tailwind CSS v4.
- **[mobile/](mobile)**: Expo (React Native) mobile client.

## Quick Start

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
```
- Server: `http://localhost:8080`
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`

### AI Service (required for food scan)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ai_service
uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8083
```
- Health: `http://127.0.0.1:8083/health`
- The gateway reads `AI_BACKEND_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8083`).

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
- Dev Client: `http://localhost:5173`

### Mobile
```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start
```

## Food Scan API

`POST /api/scans` (permission `scan.submit`, role `validator`) accepts multipart `image`, a batch ID or `qrToken`, and measured `holdingTempC`/`releaseTempC`. The Go gateway runs both AI classifiers and looks up batch, SPPG, menu, and package nutrition in the production tables. When a recipe with measured ingredient weights is available it calculates nutrition from those items; otherwise it shows the package totals or reports the data as unavailable. Legacy mobile clients may still send `items` while transitioning.

The AI service loads `backend/model_ai/food_recognition_best.pt` and `backend/model_ai/cooked_food_freshness_best.pt` by default. Override them with `AI_MENU_MODEL_PATH` and `AI_FRESHNESS_MODEL_PATH`. The menu checkpoint currently contains `test`, `train`, and `valid` as classes; the API suppresses those labels as invalid menu predictions. Use batch menu data as the displayed canonical menu, and replace/retrain the classifier before relying on its visual menu labels for Indonesian meals.
